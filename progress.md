# Final Project Progress
# First Progress Report 11/22/16
We started with the code from Lab 2 and 3, and removed the shapes and files we
did not need. We have created the user interface through QTCreator. We also have
a rudimentary start with controlling the primary (user controlled) circle
with the WASD keys.  At the moment, we are in the process of creating a multi-layered setup where the user makes several selections to create the game mode.  
The setup of the game is also slightly different from initial expectations, as we will be utilizing some portion of the lab4 planet storage method in order to hold the circles.  We are likely not using CUDA for storage unless the requirements exceed the abilities of the computers.
