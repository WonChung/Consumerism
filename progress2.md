# Final Project Progress

The user interface is ready. We just work out a small bug with how it calls the
main window. Essentially, there is a introduction window, where the user can
decide to play or quit. If the user chooses to play, a new window with the three
game modes and the instructions come on. When the user chooses a game mode, the main
window pops out. The Top Score and the Player Score are displayed on the left
hand side.

In terms of the actual game play, we have to add the other circles for the main user
circle to absorb or avoid (based on size). We are also working out a bug with
absorbing other circles. The user controls their circle with the mouse, currently.
We will add support for WASD in addition to the mouse control.
